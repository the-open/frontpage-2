OPEN’s Australian affiliate, GetUp, has been running a multi-year campaign to defend the Great Barrier Reef against a massive proposed new coal export facility, called Abbot Point. In 2015, the group exhausted their current domestic political channels. They shifted their campaign to financiers of the project. And that’s when OPEN’s international ties made a whole new level of campaigning possible.

Deutsche Bank, over which Australians have little leverage, was a major funder. OPEN’s German member, Campact, stepped up to the plate. Germans and Australians signed a joint petition to Save the Reef and jointly crowd-funded an ad in the German edition of the Financial Times. The ad coincided with a massive petition delivery at the Deutsche Bank Annual General Meeting. The next day, Deutsche Bank announced they were no longer considering funding the Abbot Point project.

Several weeks later, 38 Degrees in the United Kingdom partnered with GetUp. Shortly thereafter, Barclays Bank also took Abbot Point financing off the table.
