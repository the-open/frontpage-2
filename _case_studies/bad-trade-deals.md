OPEN member organisations and their allies are growing and engaging their membership to oppose bad trade deals – and it’s working. Millions of individuals have turned these complex and secretive agreements into attention-grabbing news events and the centers of a storms of mass mobilization.

OPEN’s community of campaigners shares best practices, resources, language, and intelligence. It creates a global laboratory that’s building the best tools to take bad traded deals down. Trade deals are not easy issues to organise around. Their complexity and secrecy can make them seem removed from citizens’ lives. They don’t fit well on a poster. **But the combined innovation and experience in the OPEN community enabled groups to fire up the grassroots and mobilize members on an unprecedented scale around the issue of trade.**

A few examples from throughout 2015: In March, ads appeared in Hawaiian papers with a message from groups in Australia, Canada, the US, New sealand, and multinational partners. “To the negotiators in Hawai’i: More than 2 million citizens from around the world say ‘No Deal’.” On April 18th groups in Germany, the UK, Sweden and Ireland took part in a global day of action – the Swedes’ very first offline event. In the fall, Romanian startup De.Clic launched their first anti-TTIP campaign just weeks after the OPEN Startup Summit’s lively trade planning session with seven OPEN members and two partners. The group successfully reached the Romanian quorum for the independent European Citizens’ Initiative on TTIP.

Campact in Germany has become OPEN’s trade powerhouse, sharing tactics, funding, resources and strategy while mobilizing hundreds of thousands of people in the streets at home.  Their members have held flash mobs at official events. Their marches attracted 50,000 people in January, 40,000 in June, and a record breaking 250,000 in October. Campact also held a successful matching fundraiser to support the Action Station’s trade campaigning, linking the TTP and TTIP fights.

In June, when the European Parliament delayed its vote on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, European Parliament ministers told media that massive pressure from citizen groups was responsible for that break-down. People power had won a landmark victory over corporate power - one that lays the groundwork for future wins - and OPEN groups were an important part of the equation.
