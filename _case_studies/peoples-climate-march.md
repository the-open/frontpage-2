OPEN members supercharged the global plan for a global climate mobilization around UN Climate Summit in September, 2014. OPEN facilitated each member organisation’s role. Planning started with a joint strategic mapping exercise. OPEN sponsored a joint staff position with ally 350.org to bring transnational climate expertise to domestic groups.

GetUp took lead responsibility for a 40,000+ person rally in Melbourne. 38 Degrees sent thousands of members to the London rally. MoveOn and Leadnow both organised major boost in turn-out for the flagship event in New York and also drove first ever physical climate rally on the United States-Canada border. Even startup groups organised or supported events.

Members were able to seamlessly exchange key mobilization resources, such as core issue messaging, high-performing turn-out email copy, graphics, and ride-sharing technology. OPEN collected images and video from all members and piped them instantly into the global press stream and video projections in New York City.
