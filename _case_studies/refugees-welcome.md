In the fall of 2015, we  all watched as the crisis in Syria and the growth of ISIS dominated headlines and conversations around the world this fall.

In September and November, OPEN groups turned a flood of emotion into meaningful policy change and support for refugee families. They raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for relief efforts. They took a stand against hate crimes and campaigned successfully to raise caps on the numbers of refugees their countries agreed to take in. They connected volunteers to aid projects, and welcomed refugees with critical resources and messages of solidarity. And when people felt helpless and hopeless, OPEN groups across the globe brought them together in community to light the darkness.

* Campact in Germany campaigned hard against anti-refugee hate speech and violence, taking the lead in Europe on this issue. They launched an interactive map of local initiatives that help refugees, connecting volunteers all over Germany.
* Aufstehn in Austria mobilized members to write to mayors to increase intake, which correlated remarkably to where intake was subsequently raised. Members sent welcoming postcards to each refugee in Austria.
* Operation Libero in Switzerland issued a stirring call to Parliament to welcome more asylum seekers and fought a deportation initiative in Parliament.
* MoveOn in the USA raised more than $200,000 for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and launched #AmericaWelcomes pressing the government to welcome 100,000 Syrians. MoveOn members made over 7,000 phone calls to Congress, helping stop an anti-refugee bill in the Senate. The group gathered 150,000 signatures, called, and held rapid-response events when governors declared their states closed to refugees. And Thanksgiving-week dinners brought together refugee families, Congresspeople, and MoveOn members.
* Leadnow in Canada turned out supporters to #RefugeesWelcome rallies across Canada and integrated demands for better refugee policies into their successful #VoteTogether election campaign.
* GetUp! in Australia brought together tens of thousands of Australians at #LightTheDark vigils that made front page news around the country, helping push the government to grant permanent protection to 12,000 refugees, additional to Australia's humanitarian intake.The group led the push for a humane conditions in camps for asylum seekers.
* Action Station in New Zealand ran a successful campaign to double the national refugee quota, including helping members organise vigils across the country. The group supported GetUp’s detention center campaign by calling on New Zealand’s government to send journalists and consular support.
* 38 Degrees in the UK organised over 600 local, member-led campaigns asking local Councils to accept more refugees. Those petitions also led to the formation of local refugee welcome action groups. Members raised more than 300 thousand pounds for a Refugee Welcome Board connecting citizens with ways to help and refugees to services.
* Uplift in Ireland's members pledged 14,000 beds for incoming refugees, crowd-funded a full-page ad in the national paper, and led the successful push to make the government up their intake cap from 600 to 4,000. Uplift’s membership doubled during this campaign.
* Skiftet in Sweden organised a candlelight that drew 2,000 people, and gathered more than 15 thousand signatures in support of welcoming refugees. They delivered more than 20 thousand kronor to the Red Cross.
