<p>We are shocked, saddened, and in deep mourning after the terrorist attacks in Paris. We stand in solidarity with the victims&#39; families, friends, and loved ones.</p>

<p>We express the same solidarity to all of the victims of ISIS across the world, including those in Ankara, Beirut, Syria, and Iraq, and to all of the refugees forced to flee their homes to escape the very terror that hit Paris.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today, we stand together for peace. We stand together for libert&eacute;, &eacute;galit&eacute;, fraternit&eacute;.</p>

<p>These words, backed by 542,044 signatures and 11 OPEN member organisations, ran in Le Monde on November 23.</p>

<p>Earlier that month, OPEN European member organisations and a pan-European ally, WeMove, took part in a training on values-based campaigning at the OPEN European Executive Directorsâ€™ Summit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Days later, the attacks in Paris and Beirut happened.</p>

<p>The groups quickly designed a petition in response, asking members to sign on to the message. Soon MoveOn in the US, Leadnow in Canada and Action Station in New Zealand joined in as well. 38 Degrees in the UK, Campact in Germany, and MoveOn funded the ad, WeMove designed it, and groups shared email language that went out to millions.</p>

<p>As emotions ran high across the world, OPEN groups responded quickly and decisively as an international community. Their members affirmed their values and presented an international message of compassion and peace.</p>
