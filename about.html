    The OPEN Theory
  </h2>
  <p>
    Every day, OPEN groups enable millions of citizens take action online and offline. As progressive organizers and activists, they face multi-national challenges like climate change, bad trade deals, and eroding access to democracy.Yet the most effective means for citizens to meet these challenges are almost always at the national level, changing public policy, media narratives, and their communities.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each OPEN member organization is an independent group working within its national context. But we problem-solve and innovate together. We share research, tools, and tactics that build our collective power. And we form bonds of trust and respect that allow our disparate organizations to become stronger together.

    The OPEN Way
  </h2>
  <p>
    The OPEN Network operates on three principles that increase members’ capacity, multiply impact, and build what OPEN is calling network generosity – an open-handed willingness to exchange resources and knowledge in order to further the global movement for progressive social change.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Low Competition
  </h4>
  <p>
    Full OPEN membership is restricted to national organizations and limited to one group per nation. This eliminates the territorialism and competition for resources, credit, and membership that so frequently block full transparency and generosity between coalition partners.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Member Ownership
  </h4>
  <p>
    OPEN’s work is supervised by a rotating Core Group appointed from member organizations. Each full member organization contributes 0.7% of their annual revenue to support OPEN and pledges to pay as much of their own networking costs as they can afford. OPEN’s general support potential grows as the network and its newest members grow. OPEN has a goal of being entirely member-funded by 2023. Member contributions increased 134% from 2013 to 2014 and are pledged to increase 247% in 2015.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Culture of Trust and Respect
  </h4>
  <p>
    High respect motivates every group to learn from and support every other. High trust enables full transparency. OPEN seeks a high degree of ideological and methodological alignment across the network, to ensure each group recognizes every other as being on the same team, even if they work on different issues at different times. This fuels the engine of collaboration.
