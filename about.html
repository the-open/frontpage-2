      <h1>Why OPEN, why now</h1>
      <p>Every day, OPEN groups enable millions of citizens take action online and offline. As progressive organizers and activists, they face multi-national challenges like climate change, bad trade deals, and eroding access to democracy.Yet the most effective means for citizens to meet these challenges are almost always at the national level, changing public policy, media narratives, and their communities.</p>
      <p>Each OPEN member organization is an independent group working within its national context. But we problem-solve and innovate together. We share research, tools, and tactics that build our collective power. And we form bonds of trust and respect that allow our disparate organizations to become stronger together.</p>
