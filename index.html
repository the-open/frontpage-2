          OPEN groups connect year-round to share lessons learned, cautionary tales and best practices to supercharge every aspect of what we do and how we do it. The combination of shared values, similar practices and almost no institutional competition creates an extremely honest, generous and valuable exchange.

        <p class="h4-sized editable">
          OPEN network members connect virtually through thousands of messages every month, live web seminars and facilitated learning circles across multiple issue and role cohorts. We gather physically at regular global and regional summits and through international staff exchanges. Over 120 such physical visits have occurred since 2014.

            OPEN helps new member organisations start, launch, grow and thrive in key nations around the world in record time.
          </p>
          <p>
            When OPEN launched in 2013, there were five founding organisations following 15 years of linear progress. Three years later, the network has more than tripled. Our priority growth areas are Europe and the Global South.
          </p>
          <p>
            OPEN helps each start-up initiative achieve the high-quality leadership, strategy, technology, funding and institutional foundation they need for success. And the OPEN peer network ensures that every startup begins with the accumulated wisdom of those who have come before.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, recent OPEN startups across 5 continents are already fighting and winning campaigns on critical issues from air quality in Poland to child poverty in New Zealand to police brutality in South Africa.
          </p>
          <p>
            Innovations in tactics and technology regularly flow from new groups to older groups and back again, accelerating progress for all.
