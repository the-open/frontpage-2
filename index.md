Here are the layouts we\'re currently considering:

* [The straightforward one that has the agreed content](/first.html): this site will have secondary pages containing material like our staff list and more extensive case studies of our work.
* [The version that focuses more on our member groups and pitches to join](/second.html): this site will move almost all of the original content into secondary pages, along with the staff list and related materials.


Have a look!
