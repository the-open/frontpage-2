  Full Member Organisations
</h2>
<div class="editable">
<p>
  In 2013 the original five member organisations gathered together for the first time. Recognizing the enormous potential for further collaboration, they came together to launch the OPEN Network.
</p>
<p>
  The membership of these five founding organisations combined is equivalent to one out of every 15 voters in their country&rsquo;s federal elections.

  Startup Organisations
</h2>
<div class="editable">
<p>
  OPEN&rsquo;s new class of startup organisations are leaping forward at a record pace. They are leveraging small staffs and budgets to mobilize tens to hundreds of thousands of supporters, with most already scoring national wins mere months after launch. Meet a few of the startups making change around the globe.

  <em>(Note: the OPEN network is growing rapidly and now includes some groups facing political repression. Therefore, this site does not reflect all current member organisations.)</em>

<h2 id="shared-dna" class="editable">Shared Strategic DNA</h2>

<div class="editable">
<p>
  Each OPEN organisation is completely autonomous and adapts methodology to match the unique context.
  However, all OPEN groups share eight common ways of working: a common DNA that allows them to work
  as a coherent and productive network.
</p>

<h3>Progressive</h3>
<p>
  OPEN members move society towards greater economic and social equality, environmental sustainability,
  peaceful coexistence, and democratic freedom. OPEN groups do not demand adherence from all members on
  all points. They weave a values-coherent community through many different topical campaign
  opportunities, allowing campaigns to cross-pollinate organically.
</p>
<h3>People-Powered</h3>
<p>
  OPEN pursues an outside power theory of change, which primarily relies on the collective force of
  large-scale citizen participation to move public and private sector decision-makers towards just
  outcomes. This is distinguished from an inside access theory of change, which relies on a special set
  of inside actors to win change through elite channels. Both theories have their place, but the
  network chooses to prioritize the former because it is more durable over time, and it more closely
  matches OPEN’s values regarding power distribution in a democracy.
</p>
<h3>Member-Led</h3>
<p>
  OPEN organisations’ agendas are set by the members themselves. Organisations achieve this though
  rigorous testing, response benchmarks, polling, voting, and anecdotal inputs. Member participation and
  the cultivation of a strong member experience generate the level of affinity and participation
  necessary. Many groups also equip members to start and run their own campaigns, and then assign
  organisation resources to promote those campaigns.
</p>
<h3>Multi-Issue</h3>
<p>
  People and nations, unlike most organisations, focus on and care about many different issues based on
  their set of values. While people choose some issues as the most important, the daily news presents
  them with a range of topics that will inflame their support or ire. The energy produced in response is
  what OPEN organisations engage in order to grow and to create change wherever change is most urgent
  and possible. OPEN organisations bring a surge of power to single-issue campaigns when it matters most.
</p>
<h3>Nimble</h3>
<p>
  When news stories, upcoming legislative decisions, or other events make action urgent, OPEN groups
  give their members a means to take immediate action. Groups must be decisive and act quickly. OPEN’s
  member organisations therefore operate in a low-bureaucracy, high-empowerment management model.
</p>
<h3>Full-Spectrum</h3>
<p>
  Full-spectrum campaigning allows members to put all of their assets to work for the social and
  political change they believe in. These include opinions, talents, social networks, specific knowledge,
  votes, and material resources, including money. OPEN organisations use digital means such as email, web
  platforms, social media, and SMS to present information and engagement opportunities. However, their
  tactics frequently draw people into offline action.
 </p>
<h3>Independent</h3>
<p>
  OPEN groups remain fiercely independent from any political party. Praise or criticism, support or
  opposition, are granted purely on the basis of issue performance. This independence also means that
  OPEN organisations must ultimately be financially beholden only to the members themselves through
  small individual contributions. All five founding OPEN organisations achieved this mark within 3.5
  years of launch.
</p>
<h3>Digital</h3>
<p>
  OPEN organisations communicate and organise digitally because digital technology allows for accessible,
  scalable, and rapid engagement. They prioritize investing in the best possible platforms and innovation.
  At the same time, each new tool is evaluated from the perspective of strategic utility and accessibility
  to individual members, who are generally not early adopters.
